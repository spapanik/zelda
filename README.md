## Installation and Usage

To install and run the server locally, you can use docker-compose.

You will need an SSL certificate (and put it in local/.ssl/certs/localhost.crt) and a private key (and put it in local/.ssl/keys/localhost.key).
You can use [mkcert] to generate them

There is a user with email `link@hyrule.gov` and password `zelda` that you can use to login.
